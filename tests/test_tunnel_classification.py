"""run_all_scrapers: a tunnel-dependent scraper (bger/bge/ju/ne) must read as
skipped, not failed, when the Mac reverse-SOCKS tunnel is down — the portal is
unreachable because the Mac was asleep at the 01:00 UTC scrape, not because the
scraper broke. Before this, a Mac-off night fired false portal-down alerts.

These cover the building blocks (the tunnel-dependent set + the listener probe);
the reclassification itself is a three-line guard on top of them.
