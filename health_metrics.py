"""Pure-read health metric collectors for the OpenCaseLaw observability layer.

Every function in this module:

- Returns ``None`` or an empty data structure on missing/inaccessible input.
- Performs no writes (no logs, no DB mutations, no file creation).
- Is unit-testable against synthetic inputs (paths are parameters).

Consumed by ``mcp_server.py``'s ``/metrics/health`` endpoint and the
``/dev/health`` dashboard. Adding a new freshness or pipeline signal:
write a reader here, add it to ``collect_health()``, render it in the
dashboard, optionally add an alert rule in ``health_alerts``.

The defaults assume the production layout (``/opt/caselaw/repo``) but
every function accepts an explicit path argument so tests can run
against tempdirs.
