"""Court-attribution checks.

Every row must have a `court` value that's in the canonical registry,
and every federal/cantonal split must be coherent (canton='CH' for
federal courts, valid 2-letter ISO for cantonal).

The canonical registry is the union of:
- _COURT_NAMES in seo_pages.py
- The COURT_DISPLAY_NAMES (or similar) in mcp_server.py
- Plus any court that build_fts5.py / merge_shards.py allows in.

Rather than hard-code, we treat the union of distinct court values
present in the DB on a known-good day as the registry, and flag any
NEW court value that appears since. New ≠ regression by itself, but
should be reviewed.
