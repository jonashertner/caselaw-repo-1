"""Duplicate-detection checks.

Two failure classes:
1. Multiple rows for the same (court, docket) — the per-canton dedup
   missed a logical duplicate. König P1 EGMR class belongs here.
2. Same decision_id family appearing in multiple courts (e.g. an
   ATF case wrongly attributed to both `bge` and `bge_egmr`).

The build_fts5._dedup_decisions() pass enforces docket+court
uniqueness. These checks catch regressions in that pass.
