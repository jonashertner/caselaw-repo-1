"""Language-attribution checks.

Every Swiss decision is in DE, FR, IT, or RM (Rumantsch). Anything
else is a scraper bug — the field was populated from the wrong
column or character-set decoded badly.

EN is the one exception, and only for Strasbourg: HUDOC publishes about
half the ECtHR corpus with English as the sole authoritative text (the
French listing row exists but carries no document — `isplaceholder`).
Those judgments are ingested as `en`. An `en` row on any *Swiss* court is
still the same scraper bug it always was, so the check is court-scoped
rather than simply widened.
