"""Quality-check runner — discovers, executes, aggregates.

Discovery: every module in `quality.checks.*` is imported. Every
top-level function whose name starts with `check_` is treated as a
check. Each check accepts `(conn: sqlite3.Connection, **ctx)` and
returns a `CheckResult` (or a list of `CheckResult`s for per-court
fan-out).

Concurrency: runs checks in a thread pool (max 4 workers since the
SQLite read-only WAL is the bottleneck). Each check opens its own
read-only connection via `_open_db()`; they don't share a cursor.

Output: writes `quality/reports/latest.json` + dated archive,
optionally appends to `quality/history.db` for drift detection.

# publish gate runs `python -m quality.cli run --critical-only --gate` with a
# 3600 s cap and no --verbose, so cli.main configures logging at WARNING and
# any INFO line is discarded; when the cap fires, the subprocess is killed
# before `run()` returns, so no report is written, no history row is appended,
# and docs/quality.json still holds the PREVIOUS day's result. Working out
# which check was in flight then requires an investigation rather than a query
# (2026-08-26).
#
# One `start` line and one `done` line per check, flushed immediately. After a
# kill, any check with a `start` and no `done` was in flight. Best-effort
# throughout: a failure to write progress must never affect a verdict.
