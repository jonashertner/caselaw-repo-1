    severity       Tier this metric defends; controls block-vs-alert.
    passed         True if the check is within its tolerance.
    metric_value   The measured value (e.g. 471 NULL dates).
    threshold      The configured threshold; None for descriptive checks.
    message        One-line human summary.
    sample_rows    Up to 5 offending rows, for triage. Each row is a
                   dict of column → value to keep the report compact.
    fix_advice     How to remediate. Either a codified remedy reference
                   ("auto-corrected by build_fts5._normalize_dates()")
                   or a manual instruction.
    court          Optional per-court scoping for drift / per-court checks.
    extra          Additional structured detail (e.g. per-bucket counts).
    elapsed_s      Wall time of the check that produced this result, set by
                   runner._run_one. Note the runner is parallel
                   (MAX_WORKERS=4), so these overlap and do NOT sum to the
